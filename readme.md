This game will take 2 players

Story: 2 gambling addicts want to have a spin on who has the better luck so they decided to play a game called the roll of death. In this game the 2 gambling degens place must place down 100k. They are locked up in basement of a chinese triad run restraunt. They can only leave when there is a winner. Since they are also adrendaline junkies they agreed that each player turn will only take 10 seconds. If it hits 11 seconds they lose 10k and it goes to the pot.


Rules:  
This game will be played with 2 6sided dies. Whoever has a higher number will win. In the case of tied numbers from both players, the initial money placed on bets will go into the pot to be won from the next round. At any time any player can leave the table, but if they do they lose everything.

Since this is a high stakes game each player must place down 5k or more per round. The highest bet must be met by the other player. If player1 places 6k and player2 places 10k, player1 has to place another 4k down, if not player1 loses the initial 6k and it goes to player2. 

Winning Losing States:
If one player forfeits the other player wins and aquires all the other persons money.

If one person can not pay ante for a new round they lost the game, and the other player wins.
